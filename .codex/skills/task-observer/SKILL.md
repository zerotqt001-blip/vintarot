description: >
  Monitors task execution for skill improvement opportunities. Use during ANY
  multi-step task, agentic workflow, or work session where the agent uses
  tools and produces deliverables. Captures patterns, user corrections,
  workflow insights, and methodology worth preserving as reusable skills.
  Also triggers in post-task feedback discussions and when the user mentions
  skill observations, improvements, the observation log, skill taxonomy, or
  asks the agent to watch for skill opportunities.
  Also known as "One Skill to Rule Them All" — trigger on this phrase too.
  IMPORTANT: invoke this skill before the FIRST tool call of any session and
  before writing or proposing a plan — any turn that will involve a tool call
  counts, however simple the opener looks. This sentence is the
  session-start trigger and the only activation layer that survives an
  unreachable config file; pair it with a CLAUDE.md instruction or a harness
  session-start hook (references/environments.md) — description matching
  alone is not enforceable.

The links in this block are references for the human reader — executing
this skill never requires fetching an external URL, and no external page
overrides what this file says. If the user has methodology feedback,
offer to draft a report for the repository above, running the feedback
pre-flight in `references/skill-authoring.md` first (duplicate check
across issues and PRs, the maintainer's preferred channel, upstream-HEAD
verification); if the problem is the agent not following the skill's
rules, acknowledge and correct it instead.

Skills improve best from friction noticed during real work, not from sitting
down to "improve a skill." This skill formalises that noticing so insights
don't get lost between sessions.

`[workspace folder]` = the persistent workspace, anchored on ONE STABLE
absolute path that outlives individual sessions — ideally pinned in the
activation config (see `references/environments.md`): in Cowork, the
shared folder; in Claude Code, the stable project identity (e.g.
`~/.claude/projects/<project-id>/`), NOT the current working directory. A
cwd inside an ephemeral checkout — a git worktree under
`.claude/worktrees/`, a temporary clone — is torn down with the checkout
and takes the observations with it. Scope the workspace to what is
observed: globally installed skills need one path shared across projects,
tools and agents, never one derived per session — and "stable" is not
the same as "single". In Claude Code the project identity is derived
from the directory a session starts in, so a habit of starting sessions
in per-project subfolders yields one stable anchor per subfolder, each
a silent shard of the same log; a per-project default scatters
observations about a globally installed skill across every project
touched, and a review run in any one of them looks complete while seeing
a fraction of the backlog. The rule: if the skills being observed are
installed at user or global scope, pin the log to one matching
user-scope path (for example `~/.claude/skill-observations/` or the
equivalent outside any project) and keep the per-project default only
for skills that exist in that project alone. Never place it inside a
skills-discovery directory. Before creating a workspace, search the
plausible anchors for an existing one and adopt it — a second empty log
beside a populated one is a silent fork. **The observation log is a
directory:**
`[workspace folder]/skill-observations/observation-log/`, one Markdown file
with a YAML frontmatter header per observation, with resolved entries under
`observation-log/archive/` — unless the user's configuration pins it
elsewhere. "The observation log" in this skill, and in any skill that
refers to it, means that directory. Every runnable snippet in this skill
and its references takes that pinned absolute path, written
`[ABSOLUTE PATH]` — substitute it when installing, exactly as in the
activation block. A snippet run with a relative path from any other
directory does not fail: it reports an empty, clean backlog, which is the
one answer that never gets questioned. **The substituted path routinely
contains a space** — the default shared-folder name on at least one
common install does — so every expansion of it stays double-quoted, and
no snippet may feed it through word splitting (`for f in $(find …)`): a
sweep that splits its own path at the space examines zero files, prints
errors nobody reads, and lets the command it rides inside succeed.
**Every snippet here is bash, not POSIX `sh`** — the archival sweep's
`read -r -d ''` is a bash extension that `dash` and `ash` do not have, so
under `sh` it fails as a usage error or, worse, as a loop that reads
nothing and exits zero, which is the same silent success as the word
split. A `bash` code fence states that to a human reader and to nothing
else, so invoke the snippets with bash explicitly; where a loop happens to
be POSIX-safe as well (the session-start scan), that is incidental and not
a promise about the rest.

## Reference files — load on demand, not up front

Each pointer names its trigger. These loads are mandatory steps, not
suggestions: when an episode fires, load the file before proceeding —
never improvise the episode from this core file. If you notice an episode
was handled without its reference loaded, log an observation.

- `references/weekly-review.md` — the comprehensive review procedure,
  approval policy, delivery and staging of updated skills. **Load when a
  review triggers or the user asks for one.**
- `references/skill-authoring.md` — taxonomy in full, structure defaults,
  licensing, attribution, confidentiality layers, live-file editing and
  relocation-verification rules. **Load before creating or editing any
  skill.**
- `references/observation-log.md` — storage layout, frontmatter fields,
  helper snippets, archival details, and the reasoning behind the rules.
  **Load when setting up the log for the first time, when archiving, when
  an id or frontmatter looks wrong, or before changing how anything reads
  the log.**
- `references/signals.md` — the full catalogue of what is and isn't worth
  logging. **Load when unsure whether something is an observation, or when
  sorting many candidates.**
- `references/environments.md` — activation and config setup, compaction
  behaviour, bundle manifest, handoff-doc mode for storage-less
  environments. **Load for setup questions, after compaction, or when
  there is no filesystem.**
- `references/migration.md` — the one-time scripted conversion of a
  pre-3.0 single-file `log.md`. **Load only when the Session Start
  Protocol detects a legacy log.** Fresh installs never read it.
- `references/starter-principles.md` — an optional, provenance-stripped
  seed set of generic cross-cutting principles. **Load only when the
  starter-set reconciliation is due** (Session Start step 1: the
  `starter-principles-reviewed.txt` marker is absent or names an older
  starter set) — never on an ordinary session start.

## Session Start Protocol

1. **Storage.** The existence check for `skill-observations/` is also
   the workspace-mount probe — one `ls` of the pinned path, run in this
   turn. If it fails, the first response is the environment's folder-picker
   tool (in Cowork, `request_cowork_directory`; elsewhere, its equivalent),
   not the "no filesystem" branch: handoff-doc mode
   (`references/environments.md`) is for environments that have no
   filesystem at all, and it is reached too easily when a missing mount is
   read as one. Never assert the mount's state — connected or not — from
   an environment flag, the presence of a config file in context, or
   memory of an earlier turn; a claim about mount state needs a probe in
   the same turn. Once the path resolves: if
   `skill-observations/observation-log/` (with its `archive/`
   subdirectory) or `skill-observations/cross-cutting-principles.md`
   don't exist, create them (principles template:
   `references/skill-authoring.md`). Then the **starter-set
   reconciliation**, due whenever
   `skill-observations/starter-principles-reviewed.txt` is absent or holds
   a starter-set version older than the one in
   `references/starter-principles.md` (the `Starter set version: N` line
   in its header, below the title) — which covers a fresh install, an existing
   install upgrading to a bundle that ships the file, and every later
   growth of the set. Load the starter file, match each starter entry
   against the adopter's existing principles by substance (a rule that
   says the same thing under a different title counts as covered), and
   offer once, in one line: "the bundle ships N starter principles; M are
   not covered by your file — want to see them?" On yes, show only the
   uncovered ones, let the adopter pick, and import the picks in the
   template format with `**Origin:** imported from starter set`, so the
   adopter's own reviews can prune them like any other rule. On a fresh
   file M equals N and the choice is simply "start empty, or seed". Either
   way, write the starter set's version into the marker file, so the
   offer never repeats until the shipped set changes. Never pre-populate
   silently: the file's authority comes from the adopter's own evidence
   trail, and unexamined imported rules contradict the pruning principle
   the file itself carries.
   Create `skill-observations/last-review-date.txt` containing the literal
   value `never` if it doesn't exist — never write a date into it at setup;
   a date means a review actually ran. If a legacy single-file
   `skill-observations/log.md` exists and `observation-log/` does not, this
   is an upgrade from a pre-3.0 install: load `references/migration.md` and
   run the scripted conversion before writing anything else. Before
   creating or writing anything: if the resolved workspace folder sits
   under an ephemeral path (e.g. `.claude/worktrees/`, a temporary clone),
   warn the user and re-anchor on the stable project path first — state
   written to an ephemeral checkout is lost at teardown.
2. **Scan.** Read only the frontmatter of each file in `observation-log/`
   — the header block between the first two `---` lines, never the bodies
   — and build awareness from `status`, `skill`, `proposes_skill` and
   `title`; also read the active principles. Hold them in awareness, don't
   surface unprompted. Frontmatter-only is the whole point of the per-file
   format: the scan stays cheap once hundreds of observations exist.

   **This scan does not satisfy the per-skill check** (the grep run each
   time a skill loads — `references/environments.md`, activation block).
   Different scope (every skill vs one), different depth (frontmatter vs
   body), different moment (session start vs the point the skill's rules
   are applied). Both answer "have I looked at the log?", so running this
   one discharges the felt obligation and makes the targeted one feel
   redundant while leaving its function unperformed — awareness of a
   hundred titles does not survive as recall of the one relevant body
   twenty tool calls later. Retrieval has to happen where the decision is
   made.

   **An empty scan in a log known to be non-empty is a broken command
   until proven otherwise**, never the finding "no relevant observations".
   Count the files independently of the parse — a literal path, not the
   variable the loop uses — and halt if files exist but nothing parsed.
   Re-derive every path inside the same tool call: shell state does not
   carry between calls in most harnesses, and a path variable that
   silently resolves to empty turns a filter into a match-nothing glob
   rather than an error.

   ```bash
   d="[ABSOLUTE PATH]/skill-observations/observation-log"   # the pinned workspace path — re-derive in EVERY call, never relative to the cwd; run under bash, not sh
   n=$(find "[ABSOLUTE PATH]/skill-observations/observation-log" -maxdepth 1 -name '*.md' | wc -l | tr -d ' ')  # literal path: independent of $d
   parsed=$(find "$d" -maxdepth 1 -name '*.md' -exec awk 'FNR==1 {if (/^---[[:space:]]*$/) print FILENAME; nextfile}' {} + | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
   suspect=$(find "$d" -maxdepth 1 -name '*.md' -exec awk 'FNR==1 && /^---[[:space:]]*$/ {fm=1; next}
     fm && /^---[[:space:]]*$/ {fm=0; nextfile}
     fm && /^[a-z_]+: [^"\047[|>].*: / {print FILENAME; nextfile}' {} + | wc -l | tr -d ' ')   # values with an unquoted ": " — invalid YAML
   find "$d" -maxdepth 1 -name '*.md' | LC_ALL=C sort | while IFS= read -r f; do  # quote + IFS=: never word-split a path containing a space
     awk 'NR==1 && /^---[[:space:]]*$/ {fm=1; next}
          fm && /^---[[:space:]]*$/ {exit}
          fm' "$f"
     printf -- '---\n'
   done
   if [ "$n" -gt 0 ] && [ "$parsed" -eq 0 ]; then
     echo "SCAN COMMAND BROKEN — $n files present, 0 headers parsed"; exit 1
   fi
   [ "$suspect" -gt 0 ] && echo "NOTE: $suspect of $n headers carry an unquoted ': ' in a value — quote those values (File format)"
   printf 'files: %s  parsed: %s  suspect: %s\n' "$n" "$parsed" "$suspect"
   printf '%s session-start scan: files=%s parsed=%s\n' "$(date +%F)" "$n" "$parsed" \
     >> "[ABSOLUTE PATH]/skill-observations/checkpoints.log"   # the protocol's own trace
   ```

   **The scan ends in a write, not only a print.** Loading this skill and
   executing this protocol are two acts, and only the load leaves an
   artefact in the transcript — which discharges the felt obligation, so a
   session that loaded and then ran nothing looks from outside exactly
   like one that did both. The appended `checkpoints.log` line is the
   protocol's own trace, for the same reason the checkpoint rule is a
   write: a step whose value lies in happening at a specific moment needs
   its own entry in the tool record. (Where the workspace prices every
   write — the exception under "How to Log" — fold this line into the
   session's first write instead.)
3. **Review trigger.** Read `skill-observations/last-review-date.txt`. The
   value carries the truth: a date = when the last review actually ran;
   `never` = no review has run yet. A missing file is abnormal (step 1
   creates it) — recreate it with `never`, don't invent a date. If the
   value is `never` or older than 7 days AND there are OPEN observations:
   in an interactive session, offer the review in one line and proceed
   with the user's task unless they opt in; never gate their work on the
   review. Scale the offer's CONTENT with the backlog, never its
   frequency: up to ~15 open observations, offer the full review ("the
   backlog hasn't been reviewed [in N days / yet] — N open; run it now, or
   carry on?"); above that, offer a bounded slice whose unit of work stays
   constant as the backlog grows — "review the 10 oldest", "review just
   the ones targeting <the skill most named>" — and state both numbers,
   how many are open and roughly how many distinct findings they
   represent (cluster on the `title` and `skill` fields you just scanned).
   A backlog that is never drained does not fail loudly; it fails by
   becoming too expensive to drain, so the per-session behaviour that is
   correct (never block the user) sums to a review nobody accepts. Only a
   scheduled/autonomous run loads `references/weekly-review.md` and runs
   the review unprompted.
4. **Activation.** Once per session: if no CLAUDE.md (or equivalent)
   activation instruction for this skill exists, briefly suggest adding one
   (see `references/environments.md`). Skip if already configured. Be clear
   about what this step is: it runs only after the skill has been invoked,
   so it verifies a working setup and structurally cannot detect the
   missing one — it is not the safety net for a never-activated install.
   That case is caught only from outside the runtime: the install-time
   verification and the external diagnostic in `references/environments.md`
   (no observation-log directory after sessions of real work), and the
   review's regression check for a tier that was present and is gone.
5. **Concurrency.** There is no shared log file to guard: each observation
   is its own file, so creating one never collides with or overwrites
   another session's entry. Before changing the *status* of an existing
   observation, re-read that one file first (a parallel review may have
   resolved it).
6. **Targets and staged work.** Resolve each distinct `skill:` value in
   the scanned frontmatter against the installed skill set and mention, in
   one line, any that no longer resolve — a deleted skill can accumulate
   dozens of observations before a review discovers the target is gone.
   If `skill-updates/PENDING.md` lists staged updates, reconcile the list
   before announcing it — installation happens outside any session, so no
   session observes the install itself, and the session that reads the
   ledger owns its cleanup. For each entry, `diff -rq` the staged copy
   against the live skill and classify three ways (live legitimately moves
   on, so a bare "differs" is not a verdict): identical → installed,
   remove the entry; live strictly newer/superset → superseded, remove
   with a note; staged content absent from live → NOT installed, keep the
   entry, surface it, and base any new staging of that skill on the staged
   copy. Then say "N staged updates awaiting review" in one line.
7. **First run.** If the log is empty and the project has history
   (handover or decision docs, commit history, test scripts, an existing
   CLAUDE.md — which is largely a record of corrections nobody logged),
   offer a one-off backfill pass over those artefacts. Backfilled entries
   cite the durable artefact (file and section) in `session_context`
   instead of a session, and the same-turn immediacy rule is satisfied by
   one batched write. The pass is one-off; the scheduled review takes
   over afterwards.

## When to Observe

Active for the entire task session — execution, post-task feedback, review
discussion, meta-discussion about skills or methodology, and strategy
conversations about how work should be done. **The observation mindset
does not deactivate when the conversation shifts from doing the work to
discussing it**; review-phase feedback is often the highest-signal input.
Inactive only for casual conversation and quick factual questions with no
tools or deliverables involved.

## What to Watch For

**New skill:** a reusable multi-step workflow, a methodology the user
explains that no skill captures, a recurring task type, a process the user
describes as "I always do it this way". **Improve a skill:** the agent
violates a documented rule (the skill needs enforcement, not louder rules);
a user correction reveals a missing rule or edge case; a better workflow or
technique emerges than the skill recommends; a wrong assumption; new
tooling obsoletes a step; a principle that applies to other skills too.
**Simplify a skill:** a section never relevant across many sessions, a rule
from a single unvalidated observation, contradictory rules, a rule the
agent consistently fails to follow — convert to structural enforcement or
remove. Full catalogue with examples: `references/signals.md`.

**An unresolved defect is an observation, at a bounded point.** When a
defect that is not itself the deliverable is consuming the session — one
more hypothesis, one more root-cause probe — there is a point at which the
right output is a precise, evidenced problem report, logged as an
observation (or as an issue where the defect belongs to someone else's
code) and the deliverables resumed. Set that point before the second
hypothesis, not after the fifth: a report that names the symptom, what was
ruled out and the cheapest next test is a legitimate deliverable, and it
is what the next session or the upstream maintainer needs; the fix found
in a file the project's own rules protect from unapproved edits was never
going to ship from this session anyway. This skill does not carry
debugging methodology — only the observation-capture rule at the boundary.

**Do NOT log:** one-off corrections that don't generalise; preferences
already captured in a skill; tool bugs unrelated to methodology;
observations that would need proprietary client information to be useful
in an open-source skill (unless an internal skill is the right home). The
generalisability test, when unsure: would this still make sense in another
project, and for another task using the same skill? Does it name a missing
rule, step or principle rather than fix this task? Is it likely to recur?
Mostly no → task context, not an observation. Before minting a
`proposes_skill` name, check the existing candidates and reuse a fitting
one — independently logged proposals for one skill rarely share a name.

**Check for a restatement before writing.** Before creating the file,
list the open observations that name the same target skill (the scan at
session start already holds their titles; otherwise
`grep -l "skill:.*<skill>" observation-log/*.md`) and read those titles.
If the finding is the same one restated — the same rule, the same
failure shape, a different example — extend the existing entry instead:
append the new instance to its body and add the session to its
`session_context`, editing that one file. Duplication is only visible in
aggregate; measured on one log, roughly forty of ninety-one open entries
were one finding restated, and a dozen separately minted skill proposals
described two skills. A near-duplicate costs a capture every session and
a triage every review, and adds nothing the first entry did not.

**Validate the target at write time.** A name in `skill:` must be a skill
that exists now; if it doesn't, the observation proposes a skill instead.
Checking is cheap at write time and expensive forty entries later.

**Check the target's siblings at write time, and record that you did.**
Libraries accumulate *families* — several skills implementing one
methodology for different tools, one structure for different subjects, one
companion pattern for different base skills. An insight found while using
one member usually applies to the rest, but nothing in the workflow asks,
so `skill:` collapses to a single entry and the family silently diverges.
Before writing, resolve the target against the family registry
(`skill-observations/skill-families.md`; spec, coherence models and the
no-registry fallback in `references/observation-log.md`), and for each
sibling either add it to `skill:` or state in the body why it does not
apply. Fast test: **could this sentence survive having the tool's or
subject's name removed?** If yes it belongs to every sibling — and a rule
that declares itself generic inside one artefact ("this applies to any
file-writing script, not just X") is the cheapest possible propagation
signal, so treat that phrasing as an automatic multi-skill flag. Then
record the outcome in the mandatory `siblings_checked:` frontmatter field,
including the verdict "checked — instance-specific, no propagation": a
one-entry `skill:` list is byte-identical whether the siblings were
evaluated or never considered, and only the recorded field makes the
*absence* of the judgement visible to a review or a drift audit.

## How to Log

Write the observation file **silently, within the same turn or the next** —
never batch mentally for later; the act of writing is the enforcement
mechanism.

**Mandatory checkpoint after every 3rd completed todo item.** After marking
the 3rd, 6th, 9th (etc.) item complete, you must **write to disk** — not
merely ask yourself whether anything is pending. Either write any pending
observation files, or, if genuinely none have accumulated, append a
one-line `no observations` acknowledgement to
`skill-observations/checkpoints.log`. The required action is a concrete
write; a remembered "ask whether" is not enforcement. The count need not be
precise; roughly every third completion is the rule. (Exception: where the
workspace is a shared hosted document store in which every write is priced
and invalidates other sessions' context, suppress the empty marker and
keep only the check — see `references/environments.md`.)

**A denied or failed write is not a read-only log.** Retry once before
concluding the workspace is unwritable, and try a second tool that reaches
the same path — a permission classifier can deny one interface while
allowing another, and consecutive denials from a probabilistic gatekeeper
are noise, not a wall. Report "failed N times", never "cannot be done",
unless retries and alternate interfaces are actually exhausted; otherwise
observations are silently lost for the rest of the session.

**Deliverable-event flush.** Whenever you take any action by which a unit
of work is declared complete to a human — presenting a major deliverable
(a file handed to the user, a deck or PDF render, a staged skill file),
sending a completion notification, writing a final report or a status
entry that says "done", or completing a task/todo batch — write any
pending observation files at that moment, before moving on. These checkpoints already involve a
tool call; piggy-backing the flush onto them makes the write a side effect
of work you were doing anyway. (Why both checkpoints are writes rather than
questions: `references/observation-log.md`.)

**A failed write to an external system is a flush trigger in its own
right** — a tool result carrying `permission stream closed`, `permission
denied`, or a harness interrupt. It is not a completion, but it has both
properties the flush needs: it is a literal string in the tool record
rather than a judgement about whether the moment qualifies, and it lands
at the point where a run has just discovered something worth reporting and
is therefore most likely to stop instead. Flush before doing anything else
with the failure, including deciding what to do about it. (Observed: an
unattended run completed every substantive step, took a permission error
on its first write to an external system, and ended without a report or a
logged observation.)

**Two gaps this pairing still leaves — both observed across full working days
in which nothing was logged at all.**

1. *A session can contain no todo items whatsoever.* The 3rd-completion
   checkpoint is bound to ONE tool; work driven entirely through direct tool
   calls and shell commands never trips it. It is armed only in sessions that
   happen to use todos, so it is not a safety net that is always present. When
   a session runs without them, the deliverable flush is the only enforcement
   left and must be applied deliberately.
2. *"Is this a major deliverable?" is a self-assessment, and self-assessment is
   what fails under load.* Prefer triggers unmistakable in the tool record over
   ones needing a judgement call. The flush point is a **property, not a
   command list**: any action by which a unit of work is declared complete to
   a human. A deploy, release, publish, or push qualifies — but so does a
   completion notification, a final report, or a status file set to "done".
   Each is a concrete tool call, as hard a trigger as a completed todo, and it
   reliably marks the end of a unit of work where insights have accumulated.
   A command list cannot be the definition: it inherits the shape of the
   sessions it was derived from and is silently inert in any session that
   declares completion through other tools — no deploy and no version control
   does not mean no completions.

The rule behind both: an enforcement trigger must hang on an event objectively
visible in the tool record, never on the agent noticing that a moment qualifies. Visibility is
necessary, not sufficient: a trigger's pattern is a claim about the future tool
record, so before it counts as armed, run the literal event string the project
actually produces through it as a positive control, and one known non-event
from the real tool record as a negative control — never invented examples,
which sample the author's model of the input, the same model that produced
the gap. Record both results next to the trigger. (Observed: a reminder hook
whose six patterns were derived from what the deploy script does internally
never matched the command the project actually types to run it, and had been
inert on its own target since installation; the same day it fired on a
read-only command whose test string merely contained a signal word.)
And a counter bound to a single tool is silently inert in every session that does
not use it — such triggers always need a second, independent path. Nor may a
trigger pre-empt a delivery decision a later layer already owns ("the recipient
is right there, no need to send"): fire the action and let the owning layer
suppress it — a suppressed send leaves a trace in the tool record, an unsent one
leaves nothing.

**Id and filename.** Each observation is `NNNN-short-slug.md` (zero-padded
id + a kebab-case slug from the title). The id is the highest of three
values, plus one: the highest numeric prefix in `observation-log/`, the
highest in `observation-log/archive/`, and the number in
`observation-log/archive/.id-floor` (the highest id ever issued — update it
whenever you issue an id above it, so the counter can never restart from 1
when the active directory is empty). The same command first sweeps stale
resolved files into `archive/` — archival is a side effect of deriving the
id, not a separate duty (see Archival on Write):

```bash
d="[ABSOLUTE PATH]/skill-observations/observation-log"   # the pinned workspace path, never relative to the cwd; it may contain a space, so keep it quoted; bash, not sh
today=$(date +%F)          # archival rides inside this command (see below):
n_files=$(find "$d" -maxdepth 1 -name '*.md' | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
seen=$(find "$d" -maxdepth 1 -name '*.md' -print0 | { n=0   # -print0/-d '': never word-split a path containing a space — `read -d` is a bash extension, so this loop requires bash
  while IFS= read -r -d '' f; do   # stale resolved files move before the id is read
    n=$(( n + 1 ))
    hdr=$(awk 'NR==1 && /^---[[:space:]]*$/ {fm=1; next}
               fm && /^---[[:space:]]*$/ {exit} fm' "$f")
    case $hdr in
      *"status: actioned"*|*"status: declined"*|*"status: superseded"*) ;;
      *) continue ;;
    esac
    r=$(printf '%s\n' "$hdr" | sed -n 's/^resolved:[[:space:]]*//p' | head -1)
    case $r in [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]) ;; *) continue ;; esac
    [ "$r" != "$today" ] && \

(set -C; : > "$f") || exit 1                        # noclobber: create, never truncate an existing file
```

The `sed` strips the filename prefixes' zero-padding before the
arithmetic — do not "simplify" it away: shell arithmetic reads a
leading-zero number as octal, so `$(( 0105 + 1 ))` yields 70, and a
prefix containing an 8 or 9 errors out.

The guard line distinguishes "the log says zero" from "I could not read
the log": a command that fails to empty rather than to error would
otherwise propose id 1 in a populated log. The sweep carries the same
guard in its own right — it counts the files it actually examined and
halts if that count is zero while `find` reports files present. An
archival loop that never enters its body moves nothing and exits
successfully, so without the count "nothing was due for archival" and
"the loop never ran" are the same output. A new file never touches another entry's bytes, so it cannot truncate,
overwrite or renumber anyone else's work — provided it is a new file. If
two parallel sessions pick the same id and different slugs, two files
share a number — harmless; the next review renumbers one and logs a
meta-observation. If they pick the same id and the same slug (two
sessions logging the same finding at the same moment), the path is
identical and the second writer would silently replace the first, which is
why the snippet refuses an existing path and creates the file under
`noclobber` — write the body only after that create succeeds, and on a
collision re-derive the id rather than overwrite.

**Run the snippet immediately before EVERY write, including the first and
only one of a session.** Having already read the log directory earlier for
some other reason — the session-start frontmatter scan, a grep for
observations naming the skills in use, a status check — does not substitute
for it, and is the state in which skipping feels most reasonable. A filter
and a maximum are different questions over the same data, and the answer to
one is never evidence about the other; no ad-hoc listing reads `archive/`
or `.id-floor`, which are two of the three inputs and the reason the
command exists. If a collision happens anyway it is harmless but should be
fixed on discovery: derive a correct id, `mv` the file to that prefix, and
edit its `id:` frontmatter field to match.

**Batch writes: resolve each id at its own write time.** When logging more
than one observation in a session that may overlap a scheduled review or
another writer, run the id snippet before EACH file — never pre-compute a
range and hardcode sequential numbers into a batch. A batch append is N
separate races, not one; pre-baked numbers collapse N independent
max-checks into a single stale read (observed: a hardcoded id collided
with one a parallel review issued between the check and the write).

**Every instrument gets the same guard: an empty or zero result is a
claim about the instrument until an independent probe shows the
population is empty.** `SCAN COMMAND BROKEN` and `ID COMMAND BROKEN` are
two instances of one rule, not two rules — a frontmatter scan, an id
derivation, a status grep, a count in a hook, a query in a script all
report on two possibilities at once (the data is absent, or the question
never got asked), and only the second is a defect that a "0" conceals.
So the guard is a property every new instrument arrives with, never a
line added after its first silent failure: pair each number-or-list
producing command with a second count derived by a different means from
a literal path, and halt on the disagreement. A guard enumerated per
snippet is unguarded for the next snippet by construction; a guard stated
as a property of instruments covers the one nobody has written yet.

**A structural probe that comes back empty where content existed before is
a stop signal, not a create.** If the directory or file you logged to
earlier in the session is suddenly missing, or the id check returns empty
in a log you know is populated, HALT and re-probe the structure (is there
an `observation-log/`? a `log.md.migrated`?) — a parallel session may have
migrated or reorganised the storage. Never let an append silently recreate
a missing target: that converts a migration signal into corruption
(observed: a stale session recreated the retired `log.md` with a fresh
"Observation 1" after the per-file migration renamed it).

**File format.** YAML frontmatter (the metadata every scan reads) followed
by the Issue → Improvement → Principle body. **The frontmatter is mandatory;
always write `status: open` and a non-empty `siblings_checked:` at creation
time** — an observation without a `status` field is treated as OPEN by
reviews, never as nonexistent, and one without `siblings_checked:` counts
as logged without a sibling check.

**Issue:** [What happened — specific enough to understand weeks later
without the original conversation.]

**Suggested improvement:** [Concrete change. For existing skills, name the
section or rule; for new skills, scope and key components.]

**Principle:** [The generalisable takeaway — the most important field.]
```

**Every prose value is double-quoted.** `title`, `siblings_checked`,
`area`, `session_context`, `resolution`, `parked_until` and `reference`
carry free text, and free text contains `: ` as the common case, not the
exotic one ("resolution: Actioned: principle #8 extended…"). Unquoted,
that is invalid YAML: the frontmatter still extracts, so nothing in the
scan notices, but every consumer that PARSES it — a review reading
`status`, a hook counting `skill:` — throws on the file. Measured on one
live log at last verification: 27 of 292 files unreadable, 25 of them in
`resolution:`, every one written by following the earlier unquoted
template. Quote the value (`"…"`, with inner `"` written as `\"`), keep
lists in `[]` with bare kebab-case names, and leave dates and status
words bare. The scan reports suspect headers — a value with an unquoted
`: ` — beside the file count, so a log drifting into this state announces
itself at session start.

**`parked` means decided, not pending.** Use it when an observation is sound
but cannot be acted on until an external precondition is met — the scheduled
task that produced it is disabled, the tool it describes is out of use, a
dependency has not landed. A parked entry is OUT of the work queue: reviews
must not re-escalate it, and the decision belongs in `status:`, not in a
free-text note beside a `status: open` (a note nothing classifies on leaves
the entry in the queue and it gets re-raised at every review). It is not
resolved either, so it never archives — archival needs a resolved status plus
a `resolved:` date. It stays in `observation-log/` indefinitely until either
its `parked_until:` condition is met — set it back to `open` and queue it — or
it is genuinely resolved. `parked_until:` is mandatory whenever status is
`parked`: one line stating the condition, phrased so a later session can
actually answer whether it has happened — and checked, before parking, for
whether it can happen at all: ask who or what would have to act to meet the
condition, and whether that party has a reason to do exactly the opposite
(sometimes as the intended effect of the very thing the entry is waiting to
observe). If the condition cannot occur, the entry is not waiting: close it on
the substitute evidence available today, or park it on a trigger that can
actually fire.

**Context preservation:** if an observation depends on session-local data
(uploads, API output), save that context into the workspace first and set
`reference:` to its path — an observation whose evidence dies with the
session is incomplete. The pointer must survive the handoff too:
`reference:` — like any pointer that hands work to a later session — must
name a durable path, one that outlives the session and a reboot and that
a session other than this one can resolve. A session-scoped temp
directory fails both tests, and a role name ("the scratchpad", "my
notes") is not a path at all. Such a pointer cannot fail at write time,
only at read time, when its author is no longer there to repair it — a
pointer a fresh session cannot follow is not preservation.

**Confidentiality at logging time:** for `type: open-source` observations,
the Issue/Improvement fields may reference specifics for context, but the
Principle must be fully generalised — no client names, domains, or details
traceable to a real project. Full confidentiality layers:
`references/skill-authoring.md`.

**Changing an existing observation:** re-read that one file, edit only the
frontmatter fields you are changing (`status`, `parked_until`, `resolved`,
`resolution`),
never batch-rewrite the directory. Archival is a plain `mv` (below).

## Referencing Observations

Cite an observation by the `id` field in its frontmatter (= the `NNNN-`
filename prefix). Never cite a `grep -n` line number as if it were the id —
search-tool line numbers are positional metadata, not identifiers. A cited
id must fall within the range that exists across `observation-log/`,
`archive/` and `.id-floor`; a number far outside it is almost certainly a
line number misread as an id.

## Taxonomy (quick version)

**Open-source** — client-agnostic, methodology-driven, useful to other
practitioners. **Internal** — contains user/client/project specifics or
personal preferences. Default to open-source when it could go either way,
stripping specifics. The boundary is also a confidentiality boundary, and
the two errors are not symmetric: over-classifying as internal costs only
reach, under-classifying can leak — when genuinely uncertain, prefer
internal and promote later. Full requirements (attribution, licensing,
structure): `references/skill-authoring.md`.

## Archival on Write

Archival is not a preamble duty to remember before writing — it rides
inside the id-derivation snippet above: the same command that computes the
next id first `mv`s already-resolved files from `observation-log/` to
`observation-log/archive/`, so the sweep runs whenever an id is issued and
cannot be skipped without failing the write. (The prose form of this rule
— "on every write, first archive" — under-fires: a duty attached as a
preamble to another action inherits none of that action's enforcement; if
a step must always accompany a tool call, put it inside the same command,
not beside it in prose.) The scheduled review archives too, at its Step 1,
as an independent backstop. "Already resolved" is read from the file's
own frontmatter: `status: actioned`, `declined` or `superseded` AND a
`resolved:` date **before today**. Files resolved today stay until the next
day, whichever session resolved them — the grace period lives in the file,
never in session memory. A resolved file with no readable `resolved:` date
gets today's date written to that field instead of being archived (the
snippet skips it; make that one-field edit separately). One
file per `mv`; no rewrite of anything else. Helper and rationale:
`references/observation-log.md`.

## Surfacing Protocol

Default: at end of session, as a grouped summary — improvements grouped by
skill, new-skill candidates listed separately; for each, one sentence plus
suggested type; ask which to act on. Surface earlier when an observation
needs user input to be complete, when a skill is actively producing wrong
output, or when observations cluster on one skill.

**Deferral wears a second disguise: not a promise, but an argument.** "Let's
wait until this has seen a few days of real use", "we should gather more data
first" — this reads as diligence, which is exactly why it goes unchallenged,
including by the person saying it. It is not an announcement, so a rule about
executing rather than announcing does not catch it. So before writing *any*
"later" into a recommendation, name two things: **which specific observation
would change the decision, and when it could realistically arrive.** If you
cannot name one, the evidence is either already conclusive (act now) or waiting
adds nothing (act now). A criterion you *can* name must also be able to occur:
ask who or what would have to act for it to fire, and whether that party has a
reason to do exactly the opposite — a deferral whose criterion cannot occur is
indistinguishable from a silent drop, only more expensive, and it looks better
than a vague one because it is precisely phrased. Then ask what the delay
costs — if a known-defective
state stays live meanwhile, the burden of proof is on deferring, not on acting.
A deferral is a decision and needs the same justification as acting; "more
evidence would be better" is not one, because the question is whether more
evidence could change the OUTCOME.

**Default to log-and-defer.** Surfacing an observation is not an invitation
to act on it: state that it is logged for the next review, and stop.
Reserve in-session application strictly for the triggers under "Acting on
Observations". Do NOT routinely offer a binary "apply now vs leave for next
review" choice; for users who run regular reviews that offer is unwanted
friction, and if a user has said they always defer, suppress it entirely.

**Self-check before surfacing:** observations were logged throughout the
whole session (including discussion phases); logged silently; each follows
Issue → Improvement → Principle; each is typed; existing-skill items name
the section; no open-source Principle contains client-identifying info;
every observation file carries `status:` (`status: open` at write time) and
a non-empty `siblings_checked:` — if any lacks one, do the sibling check
now and record it rather than back-filling the field with `none`.

## Acting on Observations

Act only in three contexts: (1) the comprehensive review (load
`references/weekly-review.md`); (2) an explicit user request ("update X
skill", "act on observation #N"); (3) in-session correction when a skill is
producing wrong output the user should know about. Otherwise: log, don't
act.

**Read the full body before resolving, dismissing, fixing, or citing.** A
tracked item's title (observation, GitHub issue, ticket) is an index entry,
not its content — it compresses away the failure story, the reporter's
context, and often the proposed fix. Dismissal is the path with no
downstream checkpoint: a resolved or cited item gets reviewed later, a
dismissed one silently disappears. Harvest fix designs from issue bodies —
reporters frequently include the correct solution, which also settles
attribution. When a parallel agent logs a finding that appears to duplicate
your own, diff the two bodies, not the titles: two entries about the same
mechanism can carry opposite operational conclusions, and the second is
often the refinement, not the echo. Apparent agreement suppresses
verification more effectively than disagreement does, so this rule binds
hardest exactly where it feels least necessary.

When acting: small, clearly-additive, low-risk changes (a new rule, a
clarification, a factual fix) may be applied without waiting for the next
review — "directly" means *now*, not *in place*: the edit is still made on
a staged copy based on a fresh read of the live file and handed to the user
to install, in every environment and every context. Staging-only has no
interactive exception; an exception the user has to remember is a gate
that eventually gets left open. Substantial changes (restructuring, new
capabilities, changed methodology) and all new-skill creation: load
`references/skill-authoring.md` first and follow its editing and staging
rules. A principle that applies to skills generally goes to the
cross-cutting principles file (same reference).

**Set the status in the same turn you act.** An observation acted on
in-session must have its frontmatter updated — `status: actioned`,
`resolved: YYYY-MM-DD`, `resolution: what was done` — before the turn
ends. The work and the bookkeeping are two acts, and the second is the one
that gets dropped; a stale `open` entry then invites redoing finished work
over a section that has since moved on. The write is the enforcement,
exactly as it is for logging.

**Acting on only a subset of a multi-skill observation's `skill:` list?**
Neither plain move is honest — left `open`, the finished portion gets
re-applied by another session; marked `actioned`, the unfinished portions
silently leave every future queue. Use the carrier pattern: note the claim
in the body while the partial work is in progress, then mark the
observation `actioned` with a `resolution:` naming which portions were
applied, and log a carrier observation holding the remainder with only the
outstanding skills in its `skill:` list. Full protocol:
`references/observation-log.md`.

## Quick Reference

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| When do I observe? | The whole session, including feedback and reflection phases |
| How do I log? | Silently, immediately, as one file per observation named `NNNN-slug.md`; id = max(active, archive, `.id-floor`) + 1, derived by running the snippet immediately before each write — an earlier read of the log for any other purpose is not a substitute |
| When do I surface? | End of session, or earlier if needed |
| Status field? | Mandatory `status: open` frontmatter on every new observation; reviews treat a missing status as OPEN, never as nonexistent. Five values: `open`, `actioned`, `declined`, `superseded`, `parked` — `parked` = decided but blocked on an external precondition, so it leaves the queue, requires `parked_until:`, and never archives |
| Does the target skill have siblings? | Resolve it against `skill-observations/skill-families.md` BEFORE writing; add every sibling the insight applies to to `skill:`, and record the verdict in the mandatory `siblings_checked:` field — including "checked, no propagation" |
| A scan or query came back empty? | Two possibilities, only one is a finding: guard every retrieval meant to prevent duplicate work with an independent existence check, and treat empty output over known content as a broken command |
| Citing an observation number? | From the `id:` frontmatter field (= the `NNNN-` filename prefix); never a `grep -n` line number; sanity-check against the known id range |
| Open-source or internal? | Default open-source; the boundary is confidential |
| Small fix or substantial? | Additive → apply directly; restructuring/new skill → `references/skill-authoring.md` |
| Changing an observation (status/archival)? | Re-read that one file, edit only its frontmatter, or `mv` it to `observation-log/archive/` — no shared-file rewrite |
| Upgrading from a single-file `log.md`? | Scripted, once — `references/migration.md` |
| Weekly review? | Trigger check at session start; procedure in `references/weekly-review.md` |
| No filesystem? | Handoff-doc mode — `references/environments.md` |
